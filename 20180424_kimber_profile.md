### About a boy

Ras was chemically baptized and found the lord Techno at Kimber.

Living in Copenhagen, Denmark, he has made it a priority to answer when Kimber calls and has even managed to save his marriage by introducing his rather lovely wife to chemical stimulants and loud throbbing music.

Rather than just play some tunes, his coping mechanisms that revolve around understanding how stuff works, combined with acute megalomania, led him to start off by dabbling in producing electronic music when his midlife crisis hit in 2016. To his credit, despite the megalomania, he quickly realised that to avoid embarrassing himself beyond what his very fair, thick but oddly frail skin could take, he needed to play and listen to a lot of tunes as well, so he took to DJ'ing in 2017.

Sixteen months have gone by since and you will find him in his studio most evenings, sifting through or playing deep, progressive, soulful, minimal techno like what comes out of Oscar Mulero's[1] PoleGroup[2], Ness[3] and Claudio PRC's[4] The Gods Planet (TGP)[5]. Other favorites of his are Brando Lupi[6], Yan Cook[7], Reeko[8], Woo York[9] and Recondite[10]

Ras' strengths is his tolerance of mind altering substances, a feel for the tunes and his work ethic. He loves good music and cuddling up with a good mixer to sift through thousands of tracks to find a few gems. In the past he has compensated for the lack of experience by preparing well, but is now starting to loosen up and go a bit more off into uncharted areas - which, if you know him, can get a little scary.

He has adopted a strategy of high intensity exposure, which his wife and children will attest to, and have played rather a lot both in his home-studio (to which you are invited to come), at parties and at a regular gig he has the first friday of each month where he plays banging, funky house like Dennis Cruz[11], Fouk[12] and Coeo[13].

Ras' most noteworthy appearance was playing the 2017 London Burning Man Decompression party.

Other than being completely bald, having three nipples, a hunch and a perpetual menacing stare, he appears to be a regular human being, but if you look closely, you will find the cuneiform serial-number under his left eyelid that his kind is known for.
